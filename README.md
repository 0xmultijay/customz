## Custom Scripts

- **custom_cd** will always keep you in your working directory even if a new block/terminal/window is launched. Linux has 'cd' built in. This is for i3 and other Desktop env.
- **install.sh** will update/upgrade and install i3 desktop env and some goodies (*installNOi3.sh just updates/upgrades and installs goodies*)
